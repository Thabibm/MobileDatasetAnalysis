Carthage needs to be installed to run this project

If you are entirly new to Carthage there are tones of resources which explains you to harness Carthage in your system!

I presonaly prefer this blog to configure carthage in your mac [Carthage Installation Instructions](https://www.andrewcbancroft.com/2015/07/29/setting-up-carthage-for-the-terminal-timid/)

After cloning this repository please make sure to run carthage update to install **Realm / RealmSwift** framework

Navigate to DataAnalysis folder where **"Cartfile"** resides inside project folder.

Then run the following command via **"Terminal" Mac command line tool** to install the Realm framework via carthage.

Hurray! Now all set to run the app.
